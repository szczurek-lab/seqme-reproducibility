# Code to reproduce the case studies in seqme

> Example use cases of [seqme](https://github.com/szczurek-lab/seqme)

Data to run the case studies are found on [gdrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z_KKT8Qicm_p3CPNbW51l940FE2JHIhU/view). Place the downloaded FASTA files in the data directory.

Each case study is in a seperate notebook, where the setup instructions are also described.
